# 2DGameEngine
Basic 2D Game Engine following ECS approach

Dependencies:
- SDL 
- Assimp
- ImGui
- SPDLog
- Lua
- GLM

The main idea of this project is to create a basic game engine that allows 2D rendering using SDL and Lua Scripting. I will focus on my own ECS implementation. I recommend vcpkg as a package manager.
